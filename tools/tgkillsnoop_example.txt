Demonstrations of tgkillsnoop, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.



This traces signals sent via the tgkill() syscall. For example:

# ./tgkillsnoop.bt
Attaching 3 probes...
Tracing tgkill() signals... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
TIME      PID    COMM             SIG  TPID   RESULT
17:16:08  4969   pthkill          15   4970   0
17:16:15  4979   pthkill          15   4980   0

The first line showed a SIGTERM (15) sent from PID 4969, 
which calls pthread_kill(), to PID 4970. 
The result, 0, means success.
